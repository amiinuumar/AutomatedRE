# Requirements for Class Diagram Generation

This repository contains the implementation of our *Requirements to Class Diagram Generation* model. The project focuses on automatically generating class diagrams from natural language requirements using machine learning techniques. Below, you can find links to the requirement problems and their corresponding solutions hosted on Google Sheets, as well as the code implementation hosted on Google Colab.

## Overview

This project aims to bridge the gap between requirements engineering and class diagram generation by leveraging a machine learning framework. The model takes natural language requirements as input and outputs class diagrams that capture key elements such as classes, attributes, and relationships.

## Requirement Problems and Solutions

The *requirement problems* and their *solutions* used in this project are documented in the following Google Sheet:

- [Requirement Problems and Solutions - Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16ONUN4s5MWKBTcZXCeCZW-Vu1hLegOf0e9LEeQQKroI/edit?usp=sharing)

This document includes various natural language requirements along with their expected class diagram solutions, which were used for training and evaluating the model.

## Code for Class Diagram Generation

The implementation of the class diagram generation from natural language requirements can be accessed and executed via Google Colab. This Colab notebook includes the full code, along with instructions to run it.

## How to Use

1. Visit the *Google Sheets* link to review the requirement problems and their solutions.
2. Open the *Google Colab* notebook to run the code for class diagram generation. You can modify the input requirements or test with your own examples to see the resulting class diagrams.
3. If you want to extend the project or use it locally, stay tuned for local installation instructions.
